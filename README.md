## **What It Does**

swund transforms Polygon into a professional trading terminal:

* Real-time **multi-chart interface** (spot + perps)
* **AI agents** for signals, trend analysis & copy-trading
* On-chain **token discovery**, watchlists & community feeds
* **Instant, gas-efficient** trade execution
* Push notifications for fills and AI alerts

---

## **The Problem It Solves**

Centralized exchanges are:

* Expensive
* Custodial
* Slow
* Lacking true intelligence

Most DEXs are clunky and don't feel professional.

**swund** leverages:

* Polygon’s ultra-fast, low-fee environment
* Chainlink price feeds
* Hybrid on-chain AI

…to deliver institutional-grade tools in a **completely decentralized**, AI-native architecture — perfect for the booming **AI + DeFi** funding vertical.

## **Features**

* **Professional multi-chart dashboard** (TradingView-like)
* **Autonomous AI agents** for real-time signals and strategy execution
* On-chain **community** features & token leaderboards
* **Push Protocol notifications** for trades & alerts
* **Mobile-first**, optimized for speed and responsiveness
* Instant, low-cost transactions thanks to Polygon

## **Roadmap – Six Waves to Mainnet & Fundraising**

**Wave 1:** Ideation & MVP – **Done**
**Wave 2:** Core Trading Engine + AI Signals – **Live on Polygon Mumbai**
**Wave 3:** Copy-trading & swund Agents – *Next 4 weeks*
**Wave 4:** Intelligent NFTs (iNFTs) – *On-chain evolving strategies*
**Wave 5:** AggLayer Cross-chain + Mobile Apps
**Wave 6:** Governance Token + DAO Treasury

---

## **Technologies Used**

* **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** – frontend
* **Solidity + Hardhat** – smart contracts
* **Polygon CDK + Mumbai/Amoy** – deployments
* **Chainlink Data Feeds + Automation** – real-time pricing
* **The Graph** – indexing trades & signals
* **Push Protocol** – live notifications
* **WalletConnect / MetaMask** – onboarding

---

## **How We Built It**

* Designed UX in **Figma → Next.js + Tailwind** implementation
* Deployed core vault & trading contracts on Polygon
* Integrated **Chainlink** price feeds
* Built hybrid **AI agents** (off-chain inference → on-chain execution)
* Added **The Graph** & Push notifications for sub-second experiences
* All community/social features stored **fully on-chain**

---

## **Challenges**

* Balancing low-latency AI inference with on-chain security
* Optimizing gas for frequent signal updates
* Building seamless mobile wallet flows

---

## **What We Learned**

* Polygon’s **<2s finality + sub-cent gas** makes it feel like Web2
* Push notifications dramatically improve retention
* Governance & tokenomics matter much earlier than expected
* Hybrid AI = best balance of speed + decentralization

---

## **What's Next**

* **swund Agents:** autonomous AI traders you can copy or stake on
* **iNFTs:** NFTs that evolve with your trading strategy
* **AggLayer cross-chain engine** (ETH, Base, Arbitrum)
* Native **iOS/Android** apps
* **Revenue-sharing SDK** for signal providers
* Governance token + DAO rollout
